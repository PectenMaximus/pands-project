### Iris Data Set Description:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The source of the Iris dataset used for this project was https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris.
