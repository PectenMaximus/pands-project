## Project Overview
This project is designed to explore the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to use pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the dataset, applying various data exploration techniques to uncover patterns and relationships between the features.

## Files Included
- Readme.md: This file, containing details about the project.
- FinalProject.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, including data loading, cleaning, exploration, visualization, addtional analysis and conclusion.
- IrisDataset.csv: The Iris dataset used for the analysis.
- AnalysisCodeOnly.py: A Python script with all the  code.
- Created Materials: Material created with the code.

## Iris Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three iris flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features:

- Sepal Length

- Sepal Width

- Petal Length

- Petal Width

These features are used to classify the flowers into their respective species. The dataset was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 and is widely used in machine learning as a beginner's dataset for classification problems.

## Data Exploration and Analysis
This section of the project focuses on:

- Loading the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Analyzing the data structure using methods like .head(), .info(), and .describe().
- Investigating class distribution and exploring the summary statistics.
- Exporting a text summary of the dataset.

## Data Visualization
Various visualisations are used in the project to help better understand the relationships between features:

- Histograms to visualize the distribution of individual features.
- Pairplots to display scatter plots and observe relationships between different features of the Iris flowers.
- Correlation Heatmap to show the correlation matrix of the dataset and understand how features are related.

## Code Structure
**FinalProject.ipynb**
- Contains all the necessary steps for data exploration, cleaning, and visual analysis in an easy-to-follow notebook format.
- Includes visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Suitable for users who prefer to interact with code and visualizations in a Jupyter environment.

**AnalysisCodeOnly.py**
- A Python script that performs the same analysis as the notebook but without visual commentary or markdown explanations.
- Ideal for users who want to run the analysis code in a standalone Python environment.
